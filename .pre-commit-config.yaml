# pre-commit configuration file
#
# TL;DR
#   pre-commit runs a series of formatters and linters on every commit.
#   If throws an error, it's usually already fixed the problem and just
#   wants you to have a look at the changes it made.
#   This file sets up pre-commit to do some basic checks, fix whitespace
#   and line endings, and run stylish-haskell.
#   To setup the pre-commit hooks, you'll need pre-commit, and install the
#   hooks by running `pre-commit install` from the repository root.
