Verifying a specification
=========================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

Given a specification, Vehicle can be used to check whether a particular
neural network satisfies it.

To do this, Vehicle relies on a type of tool called *neural network verifiers*.
As input, these tools take in a *query*, a set
of equality and inquality constraints relating the inputs and outputs of the neural network.
They then attempt to find to an input that satisfies all the constraints at the same time.
They can therefore be thought of as domain-specific SAT solvers.

However, these queries are written in a very low-level format and are often
extremely large. Furthermore they often don't support operations such as disjunction.
Consequently they are very difficult to write or read, and a single high-level
property often needs to be split up into many queries in a non-obvious manner.

However, Vehicle is capable of:

  1. generating these queries automatically from a specification.
  2. calling a verifier on the generated queries to obtain whether each query is satisfiable
     and using this information to reconstruct the truth status for the original property.

Generating verifier queries
---------------------------

Verifier queries can be generated by passing a suitable ``target`` to
the ``vehicle compile`` command, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

  vehicle compile \
    --target MarabouQueries
    --specification my/project/mnist-robustness.vcl \
    --output my/project/queries
    --network classify:my/project/mnist.onnx \
    --dataset trainingImages:my/project/mnist-trainingImages.idx \
    --dataset trainingLabels:my/project/mnist-trainingLabels.idx \
    --parameter epsilon:0.1 \

This command will create a folder ``my/project/queries`` which contains
all the necessary queries, as well as *verification plan* plan file
``.vcl-plan``. The latter contains all the information
about how the queries relate to the original property they were
compiled from.

The full list of relevant command line options are:

.. option:: --target, -t

    The compilation target. There is currently one query format supported:
    ``MarabouQueries``.

.. option:: --specification, -s

    The ``.vcl`` file containing the specification to compile.

.. option:: --declaration, -y

    The name of the declarations in the specification to compile. You may provide this
    option multiple times to compile multiple properties at once. If not provided,
    then by default all properties in the specification are compiled. When compiling
    to verify queries, the declaration provided via this option must be annotated with
    a ``@property`` annotation.

.. option:: --network, -n

    Provide the implementation of a network declared in the specification.
    Its value should consist of a colon-separated pair of the name of the network
    in the specification and a file path, i.e.

    .. code-block:: bash

      --network NAME:FILEPATH

    Can be used multiple times if the specification involves more than one network.

.. option:: --dataset, -d

    Provide a dataset declared in the specification.
    Its value should consist of a colon-separated pair of the name of the dataset
    in the specification and a file path, i.e.

    .. code-block:: bash

      --dataset NAME:FILEPATH

    Can be used multiple times if the specification involves more than one dataset.

.. option:: --parameter, -p

    Provide a parameter referenced in the specification.
    Its value should consist of a colon-separated pair of the name of the parameter
    in the specification and its value, i.e.

    .. code-block:: bash

      --parameter NAME:VALUE

    Can be used multiple times to provide multiple parameters.

.. option:: --output, -o

    The output directory in which to store the compiled queries and the verification plan.


Calling the verifier
--------------------

Given a folder ``my/project/compiled-queries`` containing queries and a verification plan generated
by the ``vehicle compile`` command above, the specification can be verified by using
the ``vehicle verify`` command, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

  vehicle verify \
    --specification my/project/compiled-queries
    --verifier Marabou

The full list of available command line arguments are as follows:

.. option:: --specification, -p

    The location of the folder containing the queries and verification plan
    previously generated by Vehicle.

.. option:: --verifier, -v

    Which verifier should be used to perform the verification.
    At the moment the only supported option is :code:`Marabou`.

.. option:: --verifierLocation, -l

    Location of the executable for the verifier. If not provided, then Vehicle
    will search for the name of the executable in the ``PATH`` environment variable.

.. option:: --proofCache, -c

    The location to write out a Vehicle proof cache that provides a permanent record
    of the results of the verification.
    This can be be used to later re-check the result in an interactive theorem
    prover.
    If this option is not present then no proof cache will be generated.

.. warning::

    The :code:`verify` command is not atomic.
    Verification involves repeatedly loading the network(s) from disk
    and Vehicle will not detect changes to the networks that occur
    while the command is running.

Compiling and verifying
-----------------------

In practice, you often want to perform the two steps above in sequence and you
don't care about the queries generated in the middle. For convenience, this
may also be performed using the ``verify`` mode by passing a ``.vcl`` file as
the value of the ``specification`` argument. When run in this mode, ``vehicle`` will
stores the queries in a temporary directory and immediately call the verifier.

.. code-block:: bash

  vehicle verify \
    --specification my/project/mnist-robustness.vcl \
    --network classify:my/project/mnist.onnx \
    --dataset trainingImages:my/project/mnist-trainingImages.idx \
    --dataset trainingLabels:my/project/mnist-trainingLabels.idx \
    --parameter epsilon:0.1 \
    --verifier Marabou

The table below contains the full list of command line arguments available
for the ``verify`` command when ``target`` is a ``.vcl`` file.

.. option:: --specification, -s

    See ``--specification`` in ``compile`` mode.

.. option:: --property, -y

    See ``--declaration`` in ``compile`` mode.

.. option:: --network, -n

    See ``--network`` in ``compile`` mode.

.. option:: --dataset, -d

    See ``--dataset`` in ``compile`` mode.

.. option:: --parameter, -p

    See ``--parameter`` in ``compile`` mode.

.. option:: --verifier, -v

    See ``--verifier`` in ``verify`` mode.

.. option:: --verifierLocation, -l

    See ``--verifierLocation`` in ``verify`` mode.

.. option:: --proofCache, -c

    See ``--proofCache`` in ``verify`` mode.

Re-checking a verification result
---------------------------------

There are several reasons why one might want to check the status of a specification
some time after having initially called :code:`verify`:

  1. The verification could be part of an automated test suite in a continuous
  integration framework.

  2. The specification could have been exported to an interactive theorem prover
  whose workflow consists of regularly rechecking the validity of proofs.

Unfortunately, depending on the size of the network and the complexity of the
specification, verification can be a very expensive procedure taking hours or days.
Therefore it is important to avoid unnecessary re-verification.

To solve this problem, the ``vehicle verify`` command can produce a *proof cache*
file, which contains:

- The original text of the specification.
- The verification status of the specification.
- The values of the provided parameters.
- The file paths of the networks and datasets provided to the original
  :code:`verify` command along with a hash of the contents of each file.

The :code:`validate` command can then be run to use the proof cache to check
the status of the specification as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   vehicle validate \
    --proofCache /my/project/spec.vcl-cache

Vehicle will read the proof cache, and use its contents to find and rehash
the networks and datasets that were used during the original verification
of the specification.
If the new hashes match those stored in the proof cache then the check passes,
otherwise the ``validate`` command will exit with an error.

.. note::

    For obvious reasons, moving or renaming any of the networks or datasets
    will result in the ``validate`` command failing.

Limitations of verification
---------------------------

As you might expect, verification is a very hard problem. Therefore there are
several limitations that users should be aware of.

Linearity
~~~~~~~~~

Quantified variables in the specification must be used in a linear manner.
For example, neither of the following is allowed:

.. code-block:: agda

  @network
  f : Vector Rat 2 -> Vector Rat 2

  @property
  p1 : Bool
  p1 = forall x . x * x > 2 => f [ x , 2 ] >= 0.5

  @property
  p2 : Bool
  p2 = forall x y . x * y > 2 => f [ x , y ] >= 0.5

In ``p1`` the variable ``x`` is used to calculate a non-linear value ``x * x``,
and  in ``p2`` the variables ``x`` and ``y`` are used to create a non-linear
value ``x * y``.

In the case where you do try to verify a non-linear property, Vehicle will use
its sophisticated auxiliary type-system to help you pinpoint the source of the
non-linearity.

Quantifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~

While verifiers can be used to verify both universal properties (i.e. with ``forall``)
and existential properties (i.e. with ``exists``) they cannot verify properties with
*alternating* quantifiers where one type of quantifier is used within the scope of the
other type of quantifier. Here are some examples.

.. code-block:: agda

  @network
  f : Vector Rat 2 -> Vector Rat 1

  @property
  good1 : Bool
  good1 = forall x . f x ! 0 >= 0.5

  @property
  good2 : Bool
  good2 = exists x . f x ! 0 >= 0.75

Property ``good1`` and ``good2`` can both be verified as they each only use a single
type of quantifier.

.. code-block:: agda

  @property
  bad1 : Bool
  bad1 = forall y . exists x . f x == y

In contrast property ``bad1`` cannot be verified as it contains a alternating ``forall``
and ``exists``.

.. code-block:: agda

  @property
  good3 : Bool
  good3 = (forall x . f x ! 0 >= 0.5) and (exists y . f y ! 0 >= 0.75)

However, property ``good3`` can be verified even though it contains both a ``forall``
and an ``exists`` as the quantifiers are not alternating (i.e. it can split into
two to form ``good1`` and ``good2``.)

.. code-block:: agda

  @property
  bad2 : Bool
  bad2 = forall x . not (forall x . f x != y)

Note, that as shown by property ``bad2`` alternating quantifiers is not a syntactic
property but a logical one. This property can also not be verified despite only
containing ``forall`` quantifiers. This is because under the rules of classical
first order logic, ``bad2`` is logically equivalent to ``bad1``.

In the case where you do try to verify a property with alternating quantifiers,
Vehicle will use its sophisticated auxiliary type-system to help you pinpoint the
source of the alternation.

Network architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verifiers tend to only support certain layer types and activation functions.
At the moment Vehicle doesn't perform any compatability checking, so please
consult the verifier's own documentation.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Verification has been shown to be an NP-complete problem so in the worst-case
all verification algorithms will take an infeasibly long time to run.
However, as with many NP-complete algorithms, in the common case performance
can be surprisingly good.

How long it takes to verify a property depends on several factors:

  1. The complexity of the property. The more SAT queries that a property
  is compiled down to, the longer it will take to verify them all. Language
  features that are likely to increase the number of queries generated are

    i. ``if`` statements
    ii. ``and`` statements underneath a ``forall`` quantifier
    iii. ``or`` statements underneath a ``exists`` quantifier

  2. The complexity of the network. The larger the number of nodes in the
  network, the longer it will take the verifier to run the query.
  In general, networks with a small number of wide layers will be easier to
  verify than networks with a large number of narrow layers.

  3. How "close" the network is to satisfying each query. If a query is easily
  satisfiable, or easily non-satisfiable then the verifier will return an
  answer quickly. The closer to the boundary the network lies with respect to
  the query, the longer it will take the verifier to make a decision.
  Unfortunately this is almost impossible to quantify to advance.
