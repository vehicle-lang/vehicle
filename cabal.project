-- Cabal project configuration file
--
-- TL;DR
--   The `cabal.project` is the basic configuration file for Cabal projects.
--   This file just points Cabal to the .cabal file for your project.
--   Any configuration that is shared by all configurations of Vehicle should
--   be put into `cabal.project.config`.
--
--   Each supported GHC version has its own version of this file, which is
--   named `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y`. If no changes are needed, that file simply
--   imports this file.
--
--   For each project file `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y` there is a corresponding
--   freeze file `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y.freeze` which records the package
--   versions and flags with which the project is known to compile.

  -- 03-04-2023:
  -- Cabal refuses to do an install of the unrelated component `vehicle:exe:vehicle`
  -- without building a full sdist for `py-vehicle-lang`. To avoid this, py-vehicle-lang
  -- is not included in the main `cabal.project` file.
  -- py-vehicle-lang/vehicle-python-binding.cabal
