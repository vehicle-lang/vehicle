-- Cabal project configuration file
--
-- TL;DR
--  The cabal.project is the basic configuration file for Cabal projects.
--  Usually, this just points to the .cabal file for your project, but it
--  may contain additional configuration options.
--  Each supported GHC version has its own version of this file, which is
--  named `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y`. If no changes are needed, that file is
--  a symlink to this file.
--  For each project file `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y` there is a corresponding
--  freeze file `cabal.project.ghc-X.Y.freeze` which records the package
--  versions and flags with which the project is known to compile.

-- Changes for GHC 9.4:
--
-- * The package linkedhashmap seems unmaintained. The latest update seems to
--   have been in 2015. Unfortunately, the constraint on containers prevents
--   vehicle from building with GHC 9.2.
