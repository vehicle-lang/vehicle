# Car controller example

A simple car controller that is formally proven to always keep the car on the road in the face of noisy sensor data and an unpredictable cross-wind. The
specification is verified in Marabou and can then be exported to Agda and
combined with a larger proof to prove that the car never leaves the road. A full
description of the setup can be found in Section 2.1 of the [Vehicle paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05207v1.pdf)).

This folder contains the following files:

- `controller.onnx` - the neural network used to implement the controller.

- `windController.vcl` - the specification describing the desired behaviour.

- `agdaProof/SafetyProof.agda` - the Agda proof the car never leaves the road.

## Verifying using Marabou

The controller can be verified against the specification by running the following command:

```bash
vehicle verify \
  --specification examples/windController/windController.vcl \
  --network controller:examples/windController/controller.onnx \
  --verifier Marabou \
  --cache examples/windController/verificationResult
```

where the last line tells Vehicle where to write out the result of the verification
which can then be used by Agda in the next step.

(Optional) If you would like to see the intermediate Marabou queries generated, you can
run the following command:

```bash
vehicle compile \
  --target MarabouQueries \
  --specification examples/windController/windController.vcl \
  --outputFile examples/windController/verificationResult \
  --network controller:examples/windController/controller.onnx
```

which will put them in the `windController-queries` folder.

## Compiling to specification to Agda

The (verified) specification may then be compiled to Agda by running the command:

```bash
vehicle export \
  --target Agda \
  --cache examples/windController/verificationResult \
  --outputFile examples/windController/agdaProof/WindControllerSpec.agda
```

The full proof safety which makes uses of the generated Agda version of the specification in `agdaProof/WindControllerSpec.agda` is found in `agdaProof/SafetyProof.agda`.
