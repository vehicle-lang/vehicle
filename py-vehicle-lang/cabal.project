-- Cabal project file
--
-- 03-04-2023:
-- This `cabal.project` file exists so that the Python source distribution for
-- Vehicle can include the source code for the `vehicle` and `vehicle-syntax`
-- projects via the symlinks under vendor.
-- If we have working source distributions for `vehicle` and `vehicle-syntax`,
-- we should graft the source distributions onto the Python sdist instead.
--
-- See the `cabal.project` file in the parent directory for more details.
