Installation
============

Installing Vehicle itself
-------------------------

Installing Vehicle is very easy via the Python package manager.
Simply run ``pip install vehicle-lang``. This will both add the
executable ``vehicle`` to the PATH variable allowing you to call
the compiler directly, as well as making the Python bindings
importable as you would any other module.

Installing syntax highlighting for .vcl files
---------------------------------------------

The syntax highlighting can be installed in VSCode by going to the
"Extensions" tab and searching for "Vehicle Syntax Highlighting".

Contributions adding syntax highlighting to other IDEs would be welcome.
The source code for the VSCode extension is available
`here <https://github.com/vehicle-lang/vscode-vehicle-syntax-highlighting>`_.

Setting up Vehicle to work with Agda
------------------------------------

If you want to enable Vehicle to work with Agda, run:

1. Run ``cabal run vehicle-build-system init-agda``

This command will add the ``Vehicle`` Agda library to the Agda ``libraries`` file
and add the ``vehicle`` executable to the Agda ``executables`` file.

The command does not install the `vehicle` library in your Agda ``defaults`` file.
Before using an Agda file generated by Vehicle you will need to add ``vehicle`` to
either your library's ``.agda-lib`` file or to your Agda ``defaults`` file.

See the Agda documentation on
`Library Management <https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/package-system.html>`_
for more details.
