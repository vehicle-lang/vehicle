# Changelog for Vehicle

## Version 0.5.1

* Fixed bug where reconstructing counter-examples from Marabou would sometimes crash.

* Improved command-line output from the `vehicle verify` command.

* Added warnings when quantified variables aren't related by equalities to network input and outputs.

## Version 0.5.0

* Asymptotically significant speedup when compiling specifications with very large
  tensors in them and a corresponding reduction in size of the `.vcl-plan` files being generated.

## Version 0.4.1

* Fixed bug where disjunctions were being evaluated incorrectly.

## Version 0.4.0

### Command-line changes

* The `compileAndVerify` command has been merged into the `verify` command.
  If the `specification` argument for the `verify` command is a folder containing a `.vclp` file then the behaviour remains identical to the `verify` command of the previous version.
  If it points to `.vcl` file then the behaviour is that of the removed `compileAndVerify` command.

* The names of the loss function values for the `verify` command's `target` argument have changed from the format `LossFunction-X` to the format `XLoss`, e.g. `LossFunction-Godel` to `GodelLoss`.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bug where `vehicle compile --help` gave the wrong list of available values for the `target` argument.

* Fixed bug where sometimes using literal numbers on one side of an inequality would fail to type-check (e.g. `forall (i : Index 5) . i <= 1`).

* Fixed issue where compiling an expression with an `if` in to Marabou would fail if one of the branches was trivial.

### Errors

* Improved informativeness of error messages thrown when attempting to verify properties with multiple network applications.

* Improved error reporting when Marabou is automatically terminated by the OS (e.g. runs out of memory)

## Version 0.3.0

### General enhancements

* The verification plan files generated by `vehicle compile -t MarabouQueries` command have been
  changed from `verificationPlan.vcle` to the more readable `.vcl-plan`.

* The proof cache files generated by `vehicle verify` command have been
  changed from `X.vclp` to the more readable `.vcl-cache`.

### Command-line interface changes

* The command `vehicle verify` now requires you to point at the folder generated by the previous
  `vehicle compile` command, rather than the verification plan file within it, and therefore the
  parameter `--verificationPlan` has been changed to `--queryFolder`.

  i.e. an old command `vehicle verify --verificationPlan=my/project/queries/verificationPlan.vcle` now
  becomes `vehicle verify --queryFolder=my/project/queries`.

### Language changes

* Added additional overload for division operator `/`. Dividing two `Nat`s together now results in
  a `Rat`.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed erroneous error message generated when giving inferable parameters an unsupported type.

* Fixed erroneous evaluation of when dividing two rationals together.

* Fixed bug where the compiler would sometimes hang when reading `.vclo` files created with an
  older version of Vehicle.

## Version 0.2.0

### General enhancements

* Added support for building Vehicle with GHC 8.10, 9.2 and 9.4.

* Vehicle now generates interface files with the `.vclo` extension that cache
  the results of type-checking. If the interface file exists and the hash matches
  then it won't re-type check the original file.

* Drastically improved the performance of type-checking (e.g. AcasXu down from 20 seconds to 0.5 seconds).

* Drastically improved the performance of compilation to Marabou (e.g. mnist-robustness now takes 1.5 seconds per image as opposed to ~50 years!).

* Logs now print out in real-time instead of at the end of compilation.

* Improved error messages which involve type declarations. The messages now display
  both the original and the expanded form of the type.

* After verification, witnesses returned by the verifier are now translated and printed out.

### Command-line interface changes

* Decoupled the compilation and verification of verifier queries in the command-line
  interface.
  The `compile` command will now generate a `verificationPlan` file that stores
  all the state needed to reconstruct the truth value of the original property from the query results.
  The `verify` command now has been altered to now take in the `verificationPlan` file and
  run it.
  The old behaviour of the `verify` command which performed both compilation
  and verification has been retained in the new `compileAndVerify` command.

* The existing `check` command has been renamed `validate`.

* The new `check` command now type-checks the specification.

* The verify command now prints out progress to the command line.

* Removed the `--redirect-output` and `--redirect-error` command line options from all modes.
  This functionality can be replicated via pipes.

### Language changes

* Added `Type` to the frontend language for the type of types.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed parsing error where unbound type arguments were being generalised over in the
  opposite order that they occur.

* Fixed parsing error when partially applying `map` or `fold`.

* Fixed typing error for `map`.

* Fixed typing error for higher-order function arguments without explicit annotations.

* Fixed typing error for let-bound expressions at the top-level scope of a declaration.

* Fixed problem with properties with no infinite quantifiers getting incorrectly
  negated when compiling to Marabou queries.

* Fixed problem where properties with `forall .. in` and ``exists .. in` were
  causing compilation to Marabou to get stuck.
