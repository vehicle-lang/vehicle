  Verify whether properties in a .vcl specification file are true or false.

Available options:
  -s,--specification FILE  Either: i) a .vcl file containing the specification
                           or ii) a folder containing the queries and
                           verification plan generated bya previous call to
                           `vehicle compile`.
  -y,--property NAME       Property in the specification to verify. Can be
                           provided multiple times. If none provided then all
                           properties in the specification will be verified.
  -n,--network NAME:FILE   Provide the implementation of a network declared in
                           the specification. Its value should consist of a
                           colon-separated pair of the name of the network in
                           the specification and a file path. Can be provided
                           multiple times.
  -d,--dataset NAME:FILE   Provide a dataset declared in the specification. Its
                           value should consist of a colon-separated pair of the
                           name of the dataset in the specification and a file

  -p,--parameter NAME:VALUE
                           Provide a value for a parameter referenced in the

                           the specification and its value. Can be provided
                           multiple times.
  -c,--cache FILE          The location that the verification cache for the
                           specification will be generated. If not provided then
                           no cache will be created.
  -v,--verifier VERIFIER   Verifier to use. Supported options: Marabou
  -l,--verifierLocation FILE
                           Location of the executable for the verifier. If not
                           provided then Vehicle will search for it in the PATH
                           environment variable.
