  Compile a .vcl specification file.

Available options:
  -t,--target TARGET       The target that the specification should be compiled
                           to. Supported options: VehicleLoss, DL2Loss,
                           GodelLoss, LukasiewiczLoss, ProductLoss, YagerLoss,
                           STLLoss, MarabouQueries, VNNLibQueries, Agda,
                           Explicit.
  -s,--specification FILE  The .vcl file containing the specification.
  -e,--declaration NAME    Declarations in the specification to include during
                           compilation. Can be provided multiple times. If not
                           provided then all declarations in the specification
                           will be compiled.
  -n,--network NAME:FILE   Provide the implementation of a network declared in
                           the specification. Its value should consist of a
                           colon-separated pair of the name of the network in
                           the specification and a file path. Can be provided
                           multiple times.
  -d,--dataset NAME:FILE   Provide a dataset declared in the specification. Its
                           value should consist of a colon-separated pair of the
                           name of the dataset in the specification and a file
                           path. Can be provided multiple times.
  -p,--parameter NAME:VALUE
                           Provide a value for a parameter referenced in the
                           specification. Its value should consist of a
                           colon-separated pair of the name of the parameter in
                           the specification and its value. Can be provided
                           multiple times.
  -o,--outputFile FILE     Output location for compiled file(s). Defaults to
                           stdout if not provided.
  -m,--moduleName MODULENAME
                           Override the name of the exported ITP module. For
                           example, compiling with 'Foo.Bar' will result in the
                           Agda module with the internal name `Foo.Bar.agda`. If
                           not provided then the name will default to the name
                           of the output file.
  -c,--proofCache FILE     The location of the proof cache that can be used to
                           check the verification status of the specification.
                           Should be parsed when compiling to an ITP.
  -h,--help                Show this help text
