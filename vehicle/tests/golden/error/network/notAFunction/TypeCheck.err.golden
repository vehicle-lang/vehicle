Error in file 'notAFunction.vcl' at Line 2, Columns 5-8: The type of @network 'f':
  Rat
is not supported as it is not a function.
Fix: Only networks of the following types are allowed:
  Tensor Rat [a_1, ..., a_n] -> Tensor Rat [b_1, ..., b_n]
where 'a_i' and 'b_i' are all constants. Provide both an input type and output type for your network.
