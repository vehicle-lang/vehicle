Error in file 'mismatchedDimensions.vcl' at Line 3, Columns 1-16: Mismatch in the dimensions of dataset 'trainingDataset'.
According to the specification it should be 2-dimensional but was actually found to be 1-dimensional when reading 'dataset-nat-4.idx'.
Fix: change the dimensions of 'trainingDataset' in the specification or check that 'dataset-nat-4.idx' is in the format you were expecting.
