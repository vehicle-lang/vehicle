Error at Line 5, Columns 1-16: The type of @parameter 'trainingDataset':
  Tensor Nat [if f [0] ! 0 > 0 then 2 else 3]
which reduces to:
  Vector Nat (if f [0.0] ! 0 > 0.0 then 2 else 3)
is not supported as the dimension size
  if f [0.0] ! 0 > 0.0 then 2 else 3
is not a constant.
Fix: make sure the dimensions of the dataset are all constants.
