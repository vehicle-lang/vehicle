Error in file 'alternatingImplies.vcl' at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains alternating 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers which is not supported by the Marabou query format.
In particular:
  1. the inner quantifier is the 'forall' located in file 'alternatingImplies.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 17-23
  2. which is turned into an 'exists' by being on the LHS of the '=>' in file 'alternatingImplies.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 42-44
  3. which alternates with the outer 'forall' in file 'alternatingImplies.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 5-11
Fix: try simplifying the specification to avoid the alternating quantifiers.
