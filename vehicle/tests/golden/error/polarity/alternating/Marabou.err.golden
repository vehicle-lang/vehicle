Error in file 'alternating.vcl' at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains alternating 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers which is not supported by the Marabou query format.
In particular:
  1. the inner quantifier is the 'exists' located in file 'alternating.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 16-22
  2. which alternates with the outer 'forall' in file 'alternating.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 5-11
Fix: try simplifying the specification to avoid the alternating quantifiers.
