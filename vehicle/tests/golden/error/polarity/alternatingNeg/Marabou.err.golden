Error in file 'alternatingNeg.vcl' at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains alternating 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers which is not supported by the Marabou query format.
In particular:
  1. the inner quantifier is the 'forall' located in file 'alternatingNeg.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 21-27
  2. which is turned into an 'exists' by the 'not' in file 'alternatingNeg.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 16-19
  3. which alternates with the outer 'forall' in file 'alternatingNeg.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 5-11
Fix: try simplifying the specification to avoid the alternating quantifiers.
