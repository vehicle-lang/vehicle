Error in file 'alternatingFun.vcl' at Line 8, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains alternating 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers which is not supported by the Marabou query format.
In particular:
  1. the inner quantifier is the 'exists' located in file 'alternatingFun.vcl' at Line 0 Column 0 - Line 5 Column 23
  2. which is which is returned as an output of the function 'existential' in file 'alternatingFun.vcl' at Line 9, Columns 24-35
  3. which alternates with the outer 'forall' in file 'alternatingFun.vcl' at Line 9, Columns 5-11
Fix: try simplifying the specification to avoid the alternating quantifiers.
