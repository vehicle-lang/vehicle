Error in file 'quantifiedVectorNat.vcl' at Line 3, Columns 5-11: unable to work out a valid type for the overloaded expression 'forall'.
Type checking has deduced that it is of type:
  (Vector Nat 2 -> Bool) -> Bool
but 'forall' has only the following valid types:
  (Vector t n -> Bool) -> Bool
  (Index n -> Bool) -> Bool
  (Rat -> Bool) -> Bool
