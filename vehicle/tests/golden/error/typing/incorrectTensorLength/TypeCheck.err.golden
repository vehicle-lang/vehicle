Error at Line 2, Columns 10-11: unable to work out a valid type for the overloaded expression '[1]'.
Type checking has deduced that it is of type:
  forallT {A} . Vector A 1 -> ?4 A
but '[1]' has only the following valid types:
  forallT {A} . Vector A n -> List A
  forallT {A} . Vector A n -> (\ A -> Vector A n) A
