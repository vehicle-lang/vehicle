Error at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains a non-linear constraint which is not supported by Marabou.
In particular the multiplication at Line 6, Columns 36-37 involves
  1. the output of network 'f' at Line 2, Columns 5-33
  2. which is used on the left hand side of the multiplication
and
  1. the quantified variable 'x' introduced at Line 6, Columns 13-20
  2. which is used on the right hand side of the multiplication

Fix: try avoiding it, otherwise please open an issue on the Vehicle issue tracker.
