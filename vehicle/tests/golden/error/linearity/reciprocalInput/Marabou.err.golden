Error in file 'spec.vcl' at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains a non-linear constraint which is not supported by the Marabou query format.
In particular the division in file 'spec.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 29-30 involves
  1. the quantified variable 'x' introduced in file 'spec.vcl' at Line 6, Columns 13-20
  2. which is used in the denominator of the division

Fix: try rewriting the specification to avoid the non-linearity.
